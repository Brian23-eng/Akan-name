      <h1> Akan Name Generator</h1>
        <p>The project is a web based application that takes a users birthday and calculates the year and the
        month they were born depending on their gender and gives them their Akan name. Fun right?
        Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their
        first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born for instance 'Kwaku'
        is a male name born on wednesday and 'Abenaa' is a female name born in a tuesday.</p>

        <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong>Did you know, former United Nations Secretary-General and recepient of Nobel
          peace prize Kofi Annan was born on a Friday. Kofi is an Akan name for a male born on Friday.
          Thats fun,right?? You too can find your birth day and corresponding Akan name.Input your gender and date
          of birth and enjoy the fun!!.</p>
